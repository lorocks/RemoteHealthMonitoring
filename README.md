# Remote Patient Health Monitoring
In this Project a Remote Patient Monitoring System is built.

# Physical Device
A device is built to measure a patient's heart rate, temperature and blood oxygen level.
<br>
This data is then sent to a web server where doctors and the patient themselves can view live statistics.
<br>
The device is built using an Arnuino Nano or ESP32 with the MAX30102 sensor being used.
<br>
# Website
The website separates doctor and patient login and displays real-time data.
<br>
The website provides options for users to input critical health information and then analyses all the data using Machine Learning.
<br>
An email feature has been implemented for doctor - patient communication.
<br>
Jobs are scheduled to run the Machine Learning analysis daily and to remove any useless data.
<br>

# Extra Features
An alert system has built to notify doctors of any emergency situation with the patient, through email and website notifications.
<br>
The Machine Learning model predicts the patient chance of diabetes and further health complications.
